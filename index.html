<p>Oh. Why hello there! Welcome to my little script-supervising corner of the Interwebs. I wish you'd stay a while, but there really isn't much to do hereâ€¦ </p>

<p>Hey, why don't I tell you about myself? My name is Jon Hudson, and I've been script-suping for five years now. By day I'm chef du garde manger, arranging salads and experimenting with frozen yogurt flavors. But by night, I'm a run-and-gun script renegade, slashing out discontinuities and feeding actors lines in their time of great need! Okay, so it doesn't sound that exciting, but I'm pretty good at it. </p>

<p>In fact, not to toot my own horn TOO much, but I'm likely the best script-supe you've ever met. (Unless you know Christine Gee-Lowrey, or Mary Cybulski, or Anthony Pettine. In which case, I'm fine with fourth-best.) I've script-suped on twenty-plus short films, as well as a "mad man with an axe"-type feature-length horror film, which was fun. I'm currently developing a personal script-suping system to assist me in the crazy, fast-paced world, but I won't get too far into that. Python and text processing seem to be real dinner-party buzzkills. </p>

<p>Anyways, glad you could stop by! You can contact me here if you need a script supe for your next blockbuster TV series, or 'Star Wars' episode eight, or whatever Tina Fey is doing next. Or if you just wanna chat, that's fine too. I'll be here, rewatching '30 Rock'. (Oh, and Claire Cowperthwaite. If you know Claire Cowperthwaite, could you get me an autograph or anything? That would be nice.)</p>
